We have learned that biological macromolecules are made from a small number of simple subunits. For example, proteins are made of only 20 different amino acids. Yet each cell needs to manufacture different protein molecules that serve wide range of functions. (a) Estimate the number of types of protein molecules each cell needs to make simultaneously. Is it on the order of 10s? 100s? 1000s? 10,000s? 100,000s? or millions? (b) These proteins assume a wide variety of shapes that allow them to perform their different functions. How is this variability achieved?

What functions do sidechains of amino acids serve in a protein?

DNA as Genetic Material

Even before the discovery of what genetic material is, scientists knew that it has three characteristics. What are they?

Explain why Griffith isolated live SIII and not live SII from the mouse that died after the injection of RII + heat-killed SIII.

Avery's results were published in 1944. Nevertheless, acceptance of DNA as transforming principle didn't come until 1950s. Was the experiment not convincing, or was there another reason for this delay?

What is the key feature of DNA that allows it to  
\-encode information?  
\-pass information from one generation to the next?  
\-replicate?  
mutate (change its information)?

Near the bottom of Watson and Crick's 1953 paper on the discovery of the structure of DNA is the following sentence:  
"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material."  
How does the structure of DNA suggest a copying mechanism?

Why is the ability to copy DNA so important?

DNA replication is remarkably accurate. Do you think it would have been possible to evolve a more accurate polymerase? If so, would it have been evolutionarily advantageous? Why or why not?

If there existed a 3'-->5' DNA polymerase, where would the energy for catalyzing the bond formation come in that reaction?
