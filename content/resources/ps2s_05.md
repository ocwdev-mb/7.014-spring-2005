description: This resource contains a solutions on three dimensional structure of
  H?D-Crys, the enzyme Phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the conversion of fructose
  6-phosphate (F6P) to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP), in step 3 of glycolysis,
  the change in free energy during the course of glycolysis and rubisco.
